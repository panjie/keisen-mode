# keisen-mode renewed

There are several `keisen-mode` working for different versions of Emacs/XEmacs/Mule:

* [Original keisen-mode](http://www.pitecan.com/Keisen/keisen.el): the
  basic version with abilities of drawing table lines in UTF characters
  freely.
* [Enhanced keisen-mode for MULE](http://www.bookshelf.jp/elc/keisen-mule.lzh):
  this version comes with serveral great enhencement but not working on
  modern Emacs.
    * Mouse support
    * Auto-recalculate the keisen after inserting text or others
* some others...

The main purpose is to make Enhanced keisen-mode for MULE works on modern Emacses.
